Part 1: Admin Authentication & Dashboard Access
Admin Login Page:

Create a secure login page, for instance, at the /admin route.

Authentication should be based on the following hardcoded credentials:

Username: admin@velvetcrumbs.lk

Password: @Imaan23

Dashboard Access:

Upon successful login, the user must be redirected to a new, protected admin view called the "Dashboard".

This dashboard should be a new navigation tab or link, visible only after a successful admin login.

Any attempt to access the dashboard URL directly without being authenticated should redirect the user back to the login page.

Part 2: Admin Dashboard - Content Management (CRUD Functionality)
The dashboard must provide a user-friendly interface to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for the following categories.

Collections Management:

An interface to manage product categories (e.g., Drinks, Spicy, Desserts).

When adding or editing a collection, the following fields are required:

Collection Name (e.g., "Artisanal Coffees")

Description (A brief summary of the collection)

Cover Image (A text field to paste an image URL from Imgur)

Products Management:

An interface to manage individual products within the collections.

When adding or editing a product, the following fields are required:

Product Name (e.g., "Caramel Macchiato")

Description (Detailed product information)

Price

Parent Collection (A dropdown menu to select from the list of created collections)

Images (A feature to add multiple image URLs from Imgur)

Duration (e.g., "15 min prep time")

Add-Ons Management:

An interface to manage optional add-ons for products.

When adding or editing an add-on, the following fields are required:

Add-on Name (e.g., "Extra Shot of Espresso," "Whipped Cream")

Additional Price

When creating or editing a product, the admin must be able to associate multiple existing add-ons with it (e.g., using checkboxes).

Part 3: Frontend Website Integration
Dynamic Content Rendering:

Remove all hardcoded/static product and collection data from the public-facing website pages.

Modify the website to fetch and display all collections, products, and their details directly from the database.

Page Functionality:

The main menu/products page should dynamically display all available collections.

Clicking on a collection should navigate to a page that displays all products associated with it.

The product detail page should show all its information: name, description, price, duration, and all associated images (preferably in a gallery or carousel).

Part 4: Order Management System
Order Table View:

Create a new "Orders" section within the admin dashboard.

This section will display a table of all incoming orders.

The table should, at a minimum, have columns for: Order ID, Customer Details, Items Ordered, Total Price, Date/Time, and Status.

Order Status Management:

The Status column in the order table must be interactive.

The admin must be able to easily toggle or change the status of each order.

The available status options should include: Placed, In Progress, Delivered, Completed, Canceled. This could be implemented as a dropdown menu or status buttons for each order row.
